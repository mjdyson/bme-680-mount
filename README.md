# bme-680-mount

A simple mounting bracked for the Pimoroni BME680 onto IGUS drag chain E2i.15.10.028.0.

Design logic: 
* Used to monitor conditions inside an enclosed 3d printer chamber
* Open design to allow uninterupted observation of chamber air
* Hole for wires to pass through
* Raised mounting points to stop thermal transfer (if that's even relevant)
* Side vents to allow air to pass behind the sensor board
